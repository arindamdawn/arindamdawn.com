How do you explain something to a **5 year old?** Make it dead simple!
So let's get started.

## Let's build a house üòç

Suppose you have to build a home. What are the things that come to your mind when you think of a home. I guess these are some of them.

* It must have doors.
* It must have windows.
* It should have a kitchen.
* It should have a bedroom.
* It should have a toilet
* Stairs maybe ... and the list goes on
  
Regardless of how any home looks from the outside, it has most of the items listed above right?. That's so silly of me to ask!

Now that you have thought of the things let's start building! We can make it the house more and more beautiful once we start building. Now how do we start?

## Step 1 - Draw a plan (Map of the house) üè†

Your home is nothing less than a beautiful drawing! When we start drawing a beautiful scenery, we first draw the rough outline of how our scenery will look like so that we can shade/color later.

Similarly to build a great home, you need to draw a plan of how the home will look like and what are things you need in the home. Most of us take help from an expert to draw the map of our home. It looks something like this.

{{< figure src="/img/html-basics-house.svg" caption="The plan of your home" alt="home plan" class="tc">}}


## Step 2 - Preparing the foundation of the home

Once you are done creating the beautiful looking map, you need to build the base of your home first. Building a rock solid base will make the home strong. Once the base is ready, the walls need to be built. You need to ensure they are very strong otherwise they might fall when a tornado or an earthquake says hello!

## Step 3 - Build the features from the list

Your sweet home is starting to get some shape! Now you need to build the important features that you listed earlier such as the doors, windows, rooms,stairs by looking the drawing of your home.

## Step 4 - Take a break and plan to make it look beautiful

Great job building your home. Now you may say that the home is very basic and there are so many things to do. Paint, electricity, water. Well we will think on that very soon. But now you can atleast stay at your home which is very very strong and is ready to get more features!

## How is HTML related to all this - Are you kidding me?

Well it's completely related. The fun starts now. You will build your own home (**website**) in this beautiful world (**internet**) now. The next part of the post will explain in few easy steps and we will together build a real world home (website) using **HTML**. And promise no hello world examples!

If you understood the above steps to build your home, you will be great at **HTML**. Believe me!

## How are they even similar?

Just like a home needs some base, so does a website (HTML). For building a home, we need bricks and steel, for building HTML we need some called **Tags** or **Markups**. Don't get confused. I will explain everything. 
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. This means it understands the language of Markups. Markups look something like this

{{< highlight html >}}
<html>
    <head></head>
    <body>
    </body>
</html>
{{< /highlight >}}


Here `<html></html>` represents the base of the HTML. The entire website content lies in between these two tags. That's simple enough right!

Now `<body></body>` represents the walls of the website very similar to the walls of your home. It contains all the features that are required in the website.

I will talk about the `<head></head>` Tags in the next post. For now understand, it is like the brain of the website.

All the websites you see everyday are built using very common set of basic features just like most of our homes have the same basic features like doors, windows, kitchen, stairs etc. In the same way all websites have a common set of "feature" tags such as

{{< highlight html >}}
<a></a>
<img>
<p></p>
<h1></h1>
<header></header>
<nav></nav>
<footer></footer>
{{< /highlight >}}

<!--adsense-->

Again I will explain all the commonly used tags in the next post. No need of getting overwhelmed. It's pretty straight-forward. Once we complete building our HTML project, I bet by that time you'll be a HTML rockstar already. 

If by any chance you did not understand anything written above, feel free to comment below and ask me anything.
